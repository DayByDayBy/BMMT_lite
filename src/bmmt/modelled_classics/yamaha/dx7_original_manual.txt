DX7  OUTLINE

As stated in the feature summary on page 1, the DX7 can be used to play pre-programmed voices, pre-programmed voices can be edited to alter their character, or completely new voices can be created from scratch. Newly created voices can be memorized for future use.
To accomplish all this, the OX7 has four main operating modes:

ï PLAY-MEMORY SELECT Mode
This is the normal performance mode, and the mode in which pre-programmed voices can be selected.


ï FUNCTION Mode
This mode permits setting parameters pertaining to the effect of the controllers (thUmbwheel, foot controller, breath controller, key after touch) and isalso used for loading and saving data.
ï EDIT Mode	}
This mode permits editing existing voice dara to create new sounds as well as creation of entirely new voices.


ï STORE Mode
Edited or newly created voices can be programmed into the memory in this riode.

All functions of the DX7 are performed in one of the above modes. Proper understanding of the functions of each mode is the key to successful operation of and performance with the DX7.

FM.TONE  GENERATION





FM Tone Generation .... Understanding the Basics

The DX7 is an P.ntirely new ,:ype of synthesizer employing An entirely new FM digital tone generation system. This unique Yamaha system permits finer control over subtle music.al nu;:incss and vastly expanded voice creation poten≠ tial compared to conventional synthesizers.

1. The Meaning of FM
FM stands for Frequency Modulation FM radio broadcasts use the same principle. One signal-the modulator-modu≠ lates a secondsignal-the r.arrier
In FM radio the carrier is an extremP.ly high "ratio" fre≠ quency and the modulator is the music sional to be braod≠ cast. In effect. the carrier "carries" the modulator sional through tne atmosphere to your receiving antenna.
2. 
FM Tone Generation In the DX7
In the DX7. the carrier signal determines rhe pi∑ch of thP. note produced and modulator determines the shape of the waveform produced and therefore its timbre. This explana≠ tion may make it look like the carrier and modulator are two entirely separate things. In fact. they are one and the same. A special oscillator unit called an "operator" can be used as either a carrier or modulator in the DX7.

1) Pitch frequency Data
Pitch frequency data from 1he DX7's -nicrocomputer sys-∑ tern determines the operator's oscillation frequency. 1Nhen the operator is used as a carrier. this frequency is equivalen1 to the pitch of the note produced. When the operator is being used as a modulator, the ratio of its frequency to that
of the carrier determines the timbre of the note produced.

ï
2) Modulation Data
This is the modulation data received from the previous operator's (modulator) output.
ï

The FM torie generator system is similar in principle, but in this case both the carrier and modulator are audible signals, and their frequencies can be almost equal.

3) 
Envelope Data
When the operator is used as a carrier the envelope data de≠ termines the volume envelope of the note produced. \'Vhen the operator Is used as a modulator the envelope data de≠ termines the timbre envelopeof  the note produced.
For example, the pitch frequency data applied to an oper≠ ator used as a carrier determines the frequency of 1he sine wave output from the operator. Inputting envelope data results in an output waveform similar to that shown In the figure.

3. Algorithms .... Combining Several Operators
The DX7 has a total of six opera1ors. The way in which these operators are combined is kno,nn as an "algorithm." The DX7 has 32 different pre-programmed algorithms. The 32 algorithms are displayed graphically along the top of the
conïtrol panel above 1:he selector keys. Taking algorithm number one a an example, the lowest two operators-1 and
3-are carriers. The four operators above the carriers will function as modulators. The output of operator 6 is fed back (feedback) to its input.
The above is a brief description of the internal workings of the Ffvl tone generator system. By varying the pitch fre≠ quency, nodulation and envelope data it is possible to edit pre-programmed voices or to create entirely new voices.

The LFO wavefonn can be used to apply vibrato, tremolo or " wow" effects to the voices, The amount of LFO n1odula.tion applied can be controlled using the 1nodulation v-,heel, foot controller, breath controller or keyboard after touch once appropriate WAVE, SPEED, DELAY and KEY SYNC parameters are set.

SPEED:
The speed (frequency) of the LFO can be set from O to
99.	O is the slowest LFO speed while 99 is the fastest.
DELAY:
This creates a delay between initial key closure and ap≠ plication of LFO modulation. A setting of O results in no delay-LFO modulation begins the instant a key is pressed≠ and a setting of 99 creates the longest delay.
PMD (Pitch Modulation Depth):
Varies, over a O to 99 range, the depth of LFO modulation applied to pitch. AO setting produces no pitch modulation. anda setting of 99 produces maximum modulation.
The P"10 function is separate from the effect of the con≠ trollers, and can be useo to apply vibrato effects that are entirely independent of the controller settings.
AMO (Amplitude Modulation Depth):
Varies, over a O to 99 range, the depth of LFO modula∑ tion applied to amplitude. AO setting produces no ampll∑ tude modulation. and a setting of 99 produces maximum modulation,
The AMD function is separate from the effect of the con∑
trol ers. and can be used to apply tremolo effects that are entirety independent of the controller senlngs.
SYNC (Synchronize):
Pressing the SYNC key alternately turns the SYNC function ON and OFF. When SYNC is ON LFO modulation beings at the same point in the LFO ,vaveform when a l<ey Is pressed. With SYNC OFF LFO modulation begins at a random point In the LFO waveform since the LFO is free
running in this mode.

PITCH:
Sensitivity to	pitc'1 modulation is variable from Oto 7. Th∑s value sets the modulation	sansitlvi1y	for	all oper≠ ators. Applying pitch modulation results in vibrato type effects.
AMPLITUDE:
Sensitivity to amplitude modulation is variable from O to 3. Amplitude modulation sensl ivlty is sat independently for each operator. Applying amplitude modulation to a mod≠ ulator creates "wo\v" effects. while applied to a carrier it results in tremolo effects.

These keys set the pitch data for each operator.

a fixed frequency is produced no matter what key ii; pressed. The frequency is set using the IFREQUENCY COARSE J  and  I FREQUENCY FINE!functions in both
modes.
SYNC (Synchronize):
When the SYNC function is ON, all oscillator begin oper≠ ation from the same phase angle (0 degrees). With SYNC OFF the phase angle at which an operator begins oscillation is carried over smoothly from Jhe preceding note. In the polyphonic mode, for example. maximum simultaneous output is 16 notes.

9) Setting the MODULATOR ENVELOPE GENERATOR.
To create the sound of a clarinet, the parameters of the modulator's envelope generator should be identical to the parameters of the carrier's envelope generator. This process can be carried out in a few seconds by using the COPY function. Using the COPY function, copy  the OPERATOR  1 envelope  generator  dat.j' to
OPERA TOR	2. Set the display to "OP 1" by presseing the IOPERATOR SELECT! key.
While pressing the I STORE j key, press this key. The
display will show the number of the operator that was selected	with	the ! OPERATOR	SELECT j key. Thi
signifies that theenvelope generator parameters, keyboaro level scaling and keyboard rate scaling parameters of OPERATOR 1 are being copied to OPERATOR 2.

While pressing the

Prass



10) Adjusting Tone

/
Display will show the OP number
that was setecced with the
OPERATOR SELECT key.

This dgnltles that the EG data of
OP1 are being copied to OP2.




Pressing each key In
succession

ï
1Nith the DX7  set in this mode, play on the keyboard
and listen to the sound produced. The sound produced
ïNill be a pure sine wave from the carrier only. Now set 1he envelope of the carrier for an appropriate sound. Next. we'll set up the modulator data.

7) Using the modulator
In this attempt to create the sound of a clarinet. OPER∑
ATOR 2 will be functioning as the sole modulator. Press the! OPERATOR 2 ! key. OPERATOR 2 is now
engaged.


ï

At this point. listen to the sound. The sound produced will probably be a little harsh. In this case, lower the
OUTPUT LEVEL of OPERATOR 2 bY pressing on the I OPERATOR SELECT J  key. While pressing on the I OPERATOR OUTPUT LEVEL!.key, lower the value of the output level using the DATA ENTRY slTde control.
With an output level setting of 61, the sound produced will approach that of an actual clarinet. Let's set the output level of OPERATOR 2 to 61. Later on, with more careful control of the envelope generators of OPERATORs 1 and 2, you can tailor the sound more precisely for your requirements.

11I Adding Modulation
Let's add a vibrato effect to the clarinet sound produced. Set the modulation controls so that the MODULATION wheel can be used to add a subtle touch of vibrato.
1. Set the LFO Waveform.
Pressing the [ LFO WAVE J key, set the wave form to "TR IANGLE".





<24>

	ï	











2. Set the LFO Speed.
Pressing	the	j SPEED I key, set  the  LFO's speed	to
"28". Thls will produce a moderately slow vibrato.
3. Set the LFO DELAY,
Pressing the IDELAY I key, set the LFO DELAY to
"36". The vibrato  effect	will	begin a few seconds
after a key is played.
4. The	modulation	controls should be set so that the
vibrato effect will be controlled solely by the Modu≠ lation wheel. Pressing the IPMDI key, set the "LFO PM DEPTH" to "O". Pressing the IAMDIkey, set the
"LFO	AM	DEPTH" to	"O". The	setting	'or	both OPERATORs 1 and 2 should be "O".
5. Set the MODULATION SENSITIVITY.
Pressing the IPITCH j key. set 1he "P MOD SENS" to
"1".	This means that	the	pitch	will	be modulated slightly by the LFO.
Pressing	the	-:-A7M-:-;:P,-:-L-:,IT=u:-:=o-=E"I key, set the "A MOD
SENS" to "0". Thesettings for both OPERATORs 1 and	2 should be "O".
6. Control	the Vibrato Effect with the  Modulation Wheel. Pressing the I FUNCTION I keys, set the DX7 to	the
FUNCTION mode.
7. 
Set the Modulation Wheel RANGE.
Pressing the jMODULATION WHEEL RANGE) key, set the RANGE to "33". This produces a slight amount of vibrato.
8 Turn PITCH ON, AMPLITUDE OFF.
Pressing the I PITCH I key. set the PITCH to "ON".
This signifies th,it the modulation wheel controls the LFO modulation of the pitch.
Pressing the !Afv1PLITUDEj key. set the AMPLITUDE to "OFF".
9. Set the EG (Envelope Generator) BIAS to dFF _ Pressing the l EG	BIAS I key, set the EG BIAS to
"OFF"
Now, by rnanioulating 1he MODULA-JON WHEEL. you should be able to control 1he amount of vibrato on the clarinet while playing.

12)  Naming the New Voice
Nearly any riame can be given to a VOICE, as long as lt is within ten characters in length. As the sound pro≠ duced here is close  to  that of an actual clarinet. let
us  call  this  VOICE:  "CLARINET-A''.  Pressing  the I EDIT/COMPARE I key, set the DX7 back to the EDIT mode. While pressing the  j NAMEI l:ey, press the char≠
acter keys in succession as shown in the figure. The cur≠ sor will moveevery time you write in a newcharacter.
